iGesture
===

A fork of the [jGesture](http://web.siruna.com/nico/jgesture/documentation.html "jGesture Plugin for JQuery") plugin for Mobile Safari. With iGesture, your Mobile Safari applications can respond to *gestures*, shapes the user draws with their finger. You can respond to swiping up, down, left or right or at a 45 degree angle, you can support circles drawn clockwise or counterclockwise, and you can respond to more complex gestures such as a square or "X." Gestured can be drawn on the entire screen or you can support gestures drawn on specific elements of the page.

**naughts and crosses**

The [naughts and crosses](naughts_and_crosses.html) demonstration page is a ridiculously simple game of naughts and crosses intended for "pass and play." To try it, download [naughts\_and\_crosses.html](naughts\_and\_crosses.html), [naughts\_and\_crosses.js](naughts\_and\_crosses.js), and of course [igesture.jquery.mobile\_safari.js](igesture.jquery.mobile\_safari.js). Put them in the same directory and use Safari to open naughts\_and\_crosses.html.

You should see a blank board:

Nota Bene: Although this repository is public, this plugin has NOT been released. I am in the process of "extracting" iGesture from another project, and it is under construction. This is not one of those "It's in beta, nudge nudge, wink wink" disclaimers, iGesture does not work as a stand-alone jQuery plugin yet.

Warning: iGesture [May Contain Underscores](http://ozmm.org/posts/javascript_style.html "JavaScript Style").
