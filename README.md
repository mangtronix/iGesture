iGesture
===

A fork of the [jGesture](http://web.siruna.com/nico/jgesture/documentation.html "jGesture Plugin for JQuery") plugin for Mobile Safari.

Nota Bene: Although this repository is public, this plugin has NOT been released. I am in the process of "extracting" iGesture from another project, and it is under construction. This is not one of those "It's in beta, nudge nudge, wink wink" disclaimers, iGesture does not work as a stand-alone jQuery plugin yet.

Warning: iGesture [May Contain Underscores](http://ozmm.org/posts/javascript_style.html "JavaScript Style").
